# react-boilerplate

Create React App with ESLint and stylelint set up.

## Code guidelines

Used style guides *(enforced with ESLint and stylelint)*:

- JavaScript: [airbnb-base](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
- CSS: [michaelx/code-guide](https://github.com/michaelx/code-guide)

## Available scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so all its scripts are available.

```sh
npm start
npm test
npm run build
npm run eject
```

In addition I added:

```sh
npm run lint:js  # uses eslint airbnb-base
npm run lint:css # uses .stylelintrc
```
